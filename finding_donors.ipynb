    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Real world applications: \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression may be used to predict the risk of developing a given disease,  like diabetes or coronary heart disease, based on observed characteristics of the patient, like: age, sex, BMI, results of various blood tests, etc. *{1}*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Strengths of the model and when it performs well:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression returns the output result with the probability of occurring. One of the strengths of this algorithm is that it is robust in the sense that independent variables don’t have to be normally distributed, or have equal variance in each group. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Weaknesses and when does it perform poorly:\n",
    "\n",
    "However, logistic regression requires much more data to achieve stable, meaningful results. This algorithm performs poorly when your training dataset is limited in size. The bigger the size of your training dataset, the better trained models you get with logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reason this algorithm is a good candidate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the decent size of our training dataset and possibile variability in data distribution, logistic regression is a good candidate to explore to perform classification analysis on the model. That's why I picked it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Real world applications: \n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes is an algorithm from the family of Naive Bayes algorithms. Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes that data is fit for contiuous data with generally normal distributions. Some of the best applications of it is image classification for medical RMI images. Pixels in those images can be considered the output features; Xi is real-valued i-th pixel. Another example in the medical field is using this algorithm to classify a person’s cognitive state, based on brain image *{2}*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Strengths of the model and when it performs well:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Gaussian Naive Bayes, the likelihood of the features is assumed to be Gaussian (normally distributed). It's well suited when dataset features are highly continuous, so it fits well in image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Weaknesses and when does it perform poorly:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes performs poorly when data is highly imbalanced. For that type of data, other Naive Bayes techniques can be better fit. An example of that can be classifying messages as spam or non-spam by looking at words combinations represented as vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reason this algorithm is a good candidate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian algorithm are powerful classification tools, and since our dataset here fits the continuous type with relatively normal distributions, I think Gaussian Naive Bayes can be a good candidate in solving this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Real world applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Decision Tree Classifier is an algorithm that performs classification by predicting the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.*{3}* For example, a decision tree could be used effectively to determine the species of an animal by mapping all the detailed characteristics determining an animal's species. *{4}*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Strengths of the model and when it performs well:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are simple to understand, interpret, and visualize. They also have a natural “if … then … else …” construction that makes it fit easily into a programmatic structure. They also are well suited for categorization problems where attributes or features are systematically checked to determine a final category. *{4}*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Weaknesses and when does it perform poorly:\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major weaknesses of decision trees is its high sensitivity to outliers. This is due to decision trees' nature of changing their structure drastically when presented with new data, resulting in changing splits, branching, depth, etc. If your training dataset involves data that has outliers/anomalies, you need to make sure the data is cleaned up first before training this algrotihm to guarantee best results.\n",
    "Another weakness for decision trees is that it can create highly biased trees when some classes in your dataset are highly dominant. Classes don't need to be equally distributed, but if one class appears 99% of the time, while the other appears only 1% of the time, then your tree will grow visibly biased toward the dominant class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reason this algorithm is a good candidate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset has relatively balanced classes and low level of outliers if any (you can see this by examining the normal distributions graphs for some of the features). I think doing classification with decision trees can be a good candidate to get a good model.\n",

    "Looking at the results above generated from predicting testing on models fit with 100% of the training data, we notice some different values for f0.5-scores, models running times, and models accuracy. From previous analysis on our training dataset, we noticed that this dataset has skewed outputs compared to inputs, which means using a metric like accuracy might not be enough to determine which of the models we're analyzing is the best for our problem. Thus, we will examine F0.5-score, which focuses on precision and gives us a better idea of the model performance. Also, we will consider testing running times. After all, we need to make sure that our model is both well-fit and reasonably time-efficient in making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Out of our 3 models, LogisticRegression has the best F0.5-score, then DecisionTreeClassifier, and the lowest is GaussianNB by around 30% than the other two\n",
    "\n",
    "- The difference between the scores of LogisticRegression and DecisionTreeClassifier is not significant\n",
    "\n",
    "- Looking at predictions running times for the models trained at 100% of training data size, we notice that GaussianNB took more significant time to run (around 150% the time of the other 2 models). So, we will exclude GaussianNB due to it's lower f-score and higher running times\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic regression, despite its name, is a linear model for classification rather than regression. Our problem here is solved with a linear approach, but since we have many inputs, there is a possibility that going with a model that take an approach > linear; may be degree-2 or degree-3, can be a more sophiticated approach that increases our F-score and precision. For that reason, I'm going to choose not to use Logistic regression in this problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- That leaves us with decision tree classifiers. It is important to point out that decision trees are simple to understand and have many advantages esp. when tuned well. Tunning a decision tree can be an intuitive process but it's rewarding. However, decision tree learners can create biased over-fitting trees if not tuned carefully. Since the output class <=50K (class 0) dominates with 75% of the outputs in the training dataset, vs 25% for the >50K class (class 1), we should be careful in tuning DecisionTreeClassifier here, by targetting tree depth and min split and leaf size hyperparameters\n",

For 100% of the training dataset, SVC took more than 80 secs compared to each of the other 3 models shown above with each staying within 1 second of training time. Overall, the amount of gain in f-score for SVC compared to the 3 models above was not worth picking it due to its huge training times."

    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised classifier model that uses training dataset features to build a model that is best visualized with a tree-like shape. Decision making (i.e. reaching a target variable) occurs by traversing the tree from the root node to leaves based on features values assigned to branches with training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our problem, our model trains by taking all the independent variables (all features in the survey, excluding income) and using those features in building a tree, step-by-step, by decising what the next move is splitting a full data node into two based on a feature value threshold or value class. The thresold or class value at which the split of the node occurs is defined at training time. This will produce a tree-like graph, that has one root node, multiple internal nodes, and outer nodes at the bottom of the tree called leaves. Splits are binary (a node branches into two nodes), which means it result in splitting X number of data records into 2 groups, the sum of which is X.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to point out here that the level of fit of our decision tree depends heavily on the shape and depth of the tree. The deeper the tree, the more fit it becomes. But high-depth trees also can reach the levels of over-fitting. So, it is important to tune our tree in a manner that it controls its depth by placing splitting rules and boundaries based on size of data in each split-candidate node."

    "- The results observed by running \"feature_importances_\" method are different than my previous intuition. I was right about thinking that hours-per-week and capital_gain both have big influence on income, but I was also worng about occupation, capital_loss, and education_level. In fact, education and occupation doesn't seem to have a huge impact on the income decision. According to data analysis: Age, hours-per-week, marital_status of being married, with capital_gain, and being a husband are the main factors here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The results above confirm my thoughts about the importance of number of work hours per week and capital_gain to decide income\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, it seems that other factors I didn't consider in my intuition play bigger roles than education and occupation in predicting income. Based on the data, age can be a big factor may be due to it's correlation with other non-existant factors like experience and seniority, which comes usually with higher income. Also, marital status seems to play another important role for income level, may be due to marital status effect on financial stability and income level\n",

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "- Both accuracy and f-score values decreased when using the top five features for training on the same model. Accuracy dropped by 0.0366 (a 4.3% decrease in accuracy), and f-score dropped by 0.0891 (a 12.7% decrease in f-score)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The only gain we saw going from all training features to only top five features was in training time. Given the decrease percentages in f-score and accuracy, if training time was a crucial factor, and time savings between the 2 cases can offset the cost impacted by getting slightly less precise results, it might be worth it considering using the reduced data over maintaining the more precise model. After all, if time is crucial in training, the time savings will offset the extra costs incurred by the drop in precision (adding some false-postivies and sending some mail to wrong people). But if the training time decrease were not enough to offset the extra waste in mailed material (due to slightly increasing the false-positive predictions), then I would stick with using the full set of features for training, and look for time savings techniques with better deployment flow, or using more efficient training systems.\n",
